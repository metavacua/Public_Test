# Jules' Introspection Tool

This repository contains a comprehensive introspection tool, `JulesIntrospector.jsx`, designed to run in a browser-based, CDN-driven environment. It provides a multi-tabbed interface for code analysis, environment profiling, and interactive exploration.

## Overview

The main application is a single React component, `JulesIntrospector.jsx`, that consolidates the functionality of several tools:

*   **Code Introspector:** A tab that allows you to paste JavaScript code and see a list of its functions and variables, generated by an AST parser.
*   **OS Profile:** A tab that assesses the browser's capabilities for running high-performance applications, providing a "Go/No-Go" assessment for features like `SharedArrayBuffer` and `crossOriginIsolated`.
*   **Interactive CLI:** A terminal-like interface for deep inspection of the runtime environment, including storage, permissions, networking, and the React component tree.

## Running the Application

This project is designed to run without a build step. All dependencies, including React and Babel, are loaded from a CDN. To run the application:

1.  **Serve the files:** You need a local web server to serve the `index.html` and `JulesIntrospector.jsx` files. A simple way to do this is with Python's built-in HTTP server:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

2.  **Open the application:** Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. The `JulesIntrospector` component will be rendered automatically.

## Key Environmental Constraints

This project operates in a unique, CDN-based environment. It's crucial to understand the following constraints when working with the code:

*   **No `import` or `export` statements:** All dependencies are loaded globally from a CDN. You cannot use `import` or `export` statements in the JavaScript code.
*   **Global React Object:** React is available as a global variable, `window.React`. All React hooks and methods must be called as properties of this object (e.g., `React.useState`, `React.useCallback`).
*   **In-Browser Transpilation:** JSX is transpiled in the browser by Babel, which is loaded from a CDN. This is why the script tag in `index.html` has the type `text/babel`.

These constraints are critical for ensuring that the application runs correctly in its intended environment. Please see the `AGENTS.md` file for more detailed instructions for agent developers.

## Development Tools

This repository includes a suite of tools to help automate the development process. These tools are located in the `tools` directory.

### Component Manager

The `component-manager.js` script helps you create and manage components.

*   **Create a new component:**
    ```bash
    node tools/component-manager.js create-component <ComponentName>
    ```
    This will create a new, self-rendering React component in the `src` directory.

*   **Set the active component:**
    ```bash
    node tools/component-manager.js set-active-component <ComponentName>
    ```
    This will update `index.html` to load and run the specified component.

### Dependency Manager

The `dependency-manager.js` script manages the CDN dependencies for the project.

*   **Inject dependencies:**
    ```bash
    node tools/dependency-manager.js
    ```
    This will read the `dependencies.json` file and inject the necessary `<script>` tags into `index.html`.
